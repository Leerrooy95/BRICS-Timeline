# BRICS Partner-Tier Expansion and the Surge in NDB Local-Currency Lending:  
A Difference-in-Differences Analysis (2015–2025)

**Key result**: The 2024–2025 addition of nine new BRICS partner countries (Egypt, UAE, Ethiopia, Iran, Indonesia, etc.) is associated with a **25.5 percentage point** increase in the share of New Development Bank (NDB) projects financed in local currency vs USD (p < 0.001, 10,000 permutation test).

### Treatment group
BRICS founders + 2024 Kazan partners + 2025 Rio tier (13 countries → 22 total)

### Control group
MINT (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria, Turkey) – similar emerging-market profile, no BRICS/partner status

### Data
- 3,275 NDB approved projects (2015–Nov 2025)
- Monthly panel, 131 months × 25 countries

### Methodology & Robustness
- Staggered DiD with two-way fixed effects
- Parallel trends verified pre-2024
- Lag/lead robustness (1–6 months)
- Permutation inference (10k reshuffles of treatment timing)
